        <p>Another fantastic Turkish mountain to climb and explore, Kaçkar is located in Turkey’s beautiful Black Sea region whose natural alpine beauty is often compared to Switzerland. Walk past the wildflowers and sheepherders with their flock, and challenge yourself to reach the peak at around 4000m.</p>
        <p>The Via Egnatia once served as the road that connected the western and eastern parts of the mighty Roman Empire and was used for both trade and military purposes.

        <p>It’s only right to start with Turkey’s most famous beach, the showstopping Ölüdeniz. Star of tourist brochures around the world. it’s USP is the calm waters of the Blue Lagoon, trapped by a long sandy (and very photogenic) spit or land.</p>
        <p>Surely the most unique beach in Turkey, gorgeous Butterfly Valley is so-called because of the hundreds of species of butterfly which make their home there every year (including the Jersey Tiger).  </p>
        <p>Patara is an astounding 11 miles long. If you like your beaches wide, sandy and blissfully free of other people then you’ll find your heaven on Patara.The reason it hasn’t succumbed to development is the presence of protected Loggerhead turtles, who lay their eggs on the beach. There are ruins of the ancient city of Patara scattered around behind the dunes.</p>
